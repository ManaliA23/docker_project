# DOCKER_PROJECT
I learnt about Docker under the guidance of **Vimal Daga Sir** under **IIEC RISE-1.0 campaign** . This is project using Docker to set-up a WebApp called **DRUPAL**

## SETUP 
My redhat-8 has docker and docker-compose installed.It also has images for mysql as well as for drupal
Otherwise the images can also be pulled from https://hub.docker.com/

## STEPS TO BUILD THIS PROJECT
1. Created a file docker-compose.yml and edit it using vim text editor `vim docker-compose.yml`
